# This project is for combining the knowledges of HTML CSS to make a highly responsive webpage
Nowadays, developers are rarely using pure HTML and CSS to make websites, since many frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue are alternatives and they could improve the development efficiency significantly. However, it is still vital for a developer to understand how HTML, CSS work and the mechanism of building a responsive website.
